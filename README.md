# Lib\_VTK\_IO

Lib\_VTK\_IO is a Fortran library to write and read data conforming the [VTK standard](http://www.vtk.org/).

Even though there are many wrappers/porting of the VTK source code (C++ code), there is not a Fortran one. This library is not a porting or a wrapper of the VTK code, but it is only an exporter/importer of VTK data format written in pure Fortran language (standard Fortran 2003) that can be used by Fortran coders (yes, there are still a lot of these brave coders...) without mixing Fortran with C++ language.

The library is still in developing and testing, this is first usable release, but there are not all the features of the stable release (the importer is totally absent and the exporter is not complete). Surely there are a lot of bugs and the programming style is not the best, but the exporters are far-complete.

The supported VTK features are:

### Exporters

#### Legacy standard
  + Structured Points;
  + Structured Grid;
  + Unstructured Grid;
  + Polydata ( __missing__ );
  + Rectilinear Grid;
  + Field ( __missing__ );

#### XML standard
+ serial dataset:
    + Image Data ( __missing__ );
    + Polydata ( __missing__ );
    + Rectilinear Grid;
    + Structured Grid;
    + Unstructured Grid;
+ parallel (partitioned) dataset:
    + Image Data ( __missing__ );
    + Polydata ( __missing__ );
    + Rectilinear Grid;
    + Structured Grid;
    + Unstructured Grid;
+ composite dataset:
    + vtkMultiBlockDataSet.

### Importers
The importers are __missing__.

## Other Features
Lib\_VTK\_IO can handle __multiple concurrent files__ and it is __thread/processor-safe__ (meaning that can be safely used into parallel frameworks as OpenMP or MPI).

Lib\_VTK\_IO supports three output formats: __ascii__, __appended-raw-binary__ and __base64__ encoded binary data.
